    <h1>F1 Team Aston Martin</h1><hr>
    <p>Aston Martin is a British car manufacturer that has participated in Formula One in various forms and is currently represented by AMR GP Limited, competing as Aston Martin Aramco Formula One Team. The company first participated in Formula One during the 1959 season, where they debuted the DBR4 chassis using their own engine, but it failed to score any points. They continued to perform poorly through the 1960 season, once again failing to score any points. As a result, Aston Martin decided to leave Formula One after 1960.</p>
