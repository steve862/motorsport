    <h1>LeMans Ford</h1><hr>
    <p>Ford's history at the 24 Hours of Le Mans is legendary, defined by its fierce rivalry with Ferrari in the 1960s, culminating in four consecutive overall wins (1966-1969) with the iconic Ford GT40, and later triumphant returns with the modern Ford GT in the GTE Pro class (2016). This success stemmed from Henry Ford II's quest to beat Ferrari after a failed buyout, leading to the creation of the dominant GT40, a story detailed in the film Ford v Ferrari. Ford is set to return to the top-tier Hypercar class in 2027 to relive that glory.</p>
