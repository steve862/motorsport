    <h1>F1 Team Audi</h1><hr>
    <p>German car manufacturer Audi is contracted to compete in Formula One as a constructor and power unit manufacturer from 2026 onwards. Audi Motorsport AG competing as Audi Revolut F1 Team was formed through the acquisition of Sauber Motorsport, with engines developed by Audi Formula Racing GmbH.</p><p>Prior to World War II, Audi's predecessor Auto Union contested Grand Prix motor racing from 1935 to 1939. Audi announced their intention to acquire Sauber—who debuted in 1993—and its Swiss facilities in 2022, ahead of new power unit and chassis regulations in 2026. The project expanded to a power unit facility in Bavaria and a technology centre in the "Motorsport Valley" of Oxfordshire, England.</p>
